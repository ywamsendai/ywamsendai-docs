title: YWAM Sendai Staff Commitments
---

This page details commitments and expectations we have for **all full-time YWAM Sendai staff**, unless exceptions granted by YWAM Sendai Staffing Stewards.

## YWAM DNA

Of course, it is necessary to have completed a YWAM DTS in order be a YWAM staff anywhere in the world. This is where the YWAM DNA is imparted. As a DTS graduate and a YWAM staff, it is important to make a commitment to the YWAM [Purpose, Beliefs & Values](../about/values.md) and the [Legacy Words & Covenants](../about/covenants.md). This is what we consider to be the YWAM DNA. All Sendai YWAMers are expected to not only know what YWAM is about, but also live it. We ask all Sendai YWAMers, new and old, to refresh themselves regularly on what it means to be a YWAMer.

## YWAM Sendai Vision

We expect all Sendai YWAMers to fully embrace the vision to become a mission hub for the whole Tohoku region. We feel that God has called YWAM Sendai to become a healthy and vibrant YWAM / UofN training centre, established specifically in order to multiply ministries throughout Sendai city and the whole Tohoku region. We want to see Japanese or Japanese-English training schools designed to equip people to reach the Japanese people specifically, and giving them practical experience in reaching the Japanese in Sendai through various ministries. The cornerstone school we are establishing is the DTS. Once this is established, we desire to run secondary schools to better equip people, including the Japanese. As we are a pioneering team, **we expect all Sendai YWAMers to be an active part of establishing our DTS**. Once we grow in number as a staff team, we would like to create circles that focus on specific ministries or schools.

## Core Schedule

All staff must make a commitment to attend all scheduled [core meetings and events](ywamsendailife.md), and to attend wholeheartedly, not out of simple obligation.

**Note for families with small children:** We value doing ministry as a family! If you feel able, children are welcome at all of our core schedule! But we realise that each family and child is different. We ask that at least one parent attend each of the scheduled core meetings or events, and that each parent try to alternate when possible. This is so that one of the parents doesn't become disconnected from our community.

## Roles

Each staff member will be assigned roles. These roles are expected to be carried out to a high standard (as if to the Lord). Staff members should take care in carrying out their role's accountabilities within the scope of YWAM Sendai's Vision. 

## Communication

As we all live in separate homes, we need to communicate well both in person and online. We need to aim to over-communicate, rather than under-communicate. All Sendai YWAMers are expected to be active and attentive to all communication done over [Discord](communication.md), not simply to wait until a scheduled in-person meeting.

## Japanese Language & Culture

Joining us in Japan means God brought you to Japan in order to love the Japanese people. In order to do this, you will need to both speak to and listen to people's hearts. All Sendai YWAMers are expected to develop a passion to learn Japanese culture and language, and to keep learning even when it gets tough.

One good way to learn is to pursue opportunities to be immersed in Japanese-only settings (e.g. church). This can be difficult, especially at the beginning--but it is worth it! Also, food is a huge part of Japanese culture. We encourage you to try everything at least twice (even if you're not too sure!) and cook Japanese food at home and as a community. This attitude will speak volumes!

Learning this language requires discipline and good strategy. We encourage each YWAMer to set achievable goals in language study and to stick to a study schedule. We are in this together, so we ask everyone to keep each other accountable. As we want to be a multilingual YWAM community with Japanese as our common language, we challenge each YWAMer to speak in Japanese together. This is a great way to practice (and stay humble!).

There are many opportunities to practice and learn the language in Sendai. Please seek them out! Read [this page](../lifeinjapan/language.md) for a suggested plan to learn this language.

## Time Management

It is expected that each of our staff manage their time well, giving around 35 hours per week to “work” (not including meals, personal time with God, personal skill development/hobbies, fellowship with each other etc.). What would this look like?

Category | Hours per Week | Description
--------- | --------- | ---------
**YWAM Sendai Functioning** | 7 hours (20% of time) | All scheduled core meetings, role-related administrative work, etc.
**Ministry** | 28 hours (80% of time) | DTS/other UofN school prep/running, Kokubuncho (red-light district) ministry, Kokoro Kitchen, park/sports ministry, homeless ministry, meeting Japanese people, evangelism, discipleship, prayer walking, event prep, etc.

**Note on language study:** For all new non-Japanese speaking staff, it is encouraged that most of the ministry time be spent studying the Japanese language for the first two years in Japan (outside of DTS season). After the first two years, staff can use up to 7 hours of ministry time to study the language (leaving at least 21 hours for ministry). Any other language study should be seen as in your own time.

**Note for families with small children:** We have a lot of flexiblity and grace for this season you are in! Please speak with a Staffing Steward about expectations regarding time commitments.

## Local Church

Though we as YWAMers worship together and function as the Body of Christ, we expect that all Sendai YWAMers be an active part of a local expression of Church. This could be an established church or a house church, or you could start your own church if you feel led in that direction. Regardless of how this looks, we desire to love, serve, and be an encouragement to God's people here in Sendai.

## YWAM Japan & International Gatherings

All Sendai YWAMers are expected make it a priority to attend YWAM gatherings. This includes YWAM International gatherings (such as YWAM Together), YWAM Japan gatherings, and ministry focused gatherings (such as DTS Workshops).

## Financial Support

All staff are required to raise a minimum amount of monthly support in order to join us. You can find this information [here](fundraising.md).

We require this amount as each staff member is responsible to make all required monthly payments in order to live here: rent, utilities, phone bills, health insurance, etc. YWAM Sendai is not responsible for your finances, so missed payments could mean penalty fees, jail time, or even deportation.

There is always need for ongoing [fundraising](fundraising.md). This is due to a combination of rising living expenses here, as well as decreased financial support over time. It is vital to communicate regularly to supporters and churches, both for prayer support and for financial support. It is also important to make trips to visit supporters and churches around once every two years for a month or two in order to renew connections with supporters, churches, family and friends.

## YWAMer Fees

As each YWAMer is financially supported in order to live in Japan, YWAMers' needs are met. Though this is the case, YWAM Sendai has expenses that are not met because we do not have our own regular income. In order to meet these needs, we ask that each YWAMer pay a monthly staff fee of ¥6,000.

The following are ways in which this money may be used:

- At least ¥1,000 goes to the YWAM Japan National Office
- Fund to purchase and maintain a building (for office, meetings, cafe, school lectures, public worship etc.)
- Emergency fund (disaster relief etc.)
- Ministry events
- Admin costs (printing, website, office supplies etc.)
- Purchasing shared assets (computer, projector, instruments, vehicle etc.)
- Community meeting supplies (coffee, snacks etc.)
- Fund to purchase and maintain a vehicle
- Hospitality (hosting guests, volunteers & teams)
- Donate to local churches and ministries
- Rent and utilities of YWAM facilities

Please feel free to ask us specific questions regarding the staff fee. We want to be as transparent as possible in regards to community finances!
