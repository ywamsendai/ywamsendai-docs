This page outlines a general onboarding process of YWAM locations in Japan. This may differ depending on the location. Please contact them directly for more information.

**Note:** You will have had to have completed a YWAM DTS somewhere in the world to start the staff application process at any of our locations.

- First, you can explore this documentation!
- Either connect with your chosen YWAM location directly, or connect with us via [Element](https://matrix.to/#/#ywamjapan-general:matrix.org). Introduce yourself, and ask us questions!
- You will likely be sent a **Staff Application** form. Once you complete this, **Character Reference** forms will likely be sent to three people that know you. (A video chat may also be a part of this process here)
- Once the references have been received, a group of staff will pray and discuss about whether they feel the location is where God wants you to be. You will then be informed if they are happy continuing with the process, or not. (If not, you may want to contact a different location.)
- If they feel peace about moving forward, they may send you other forms, such as a **Medical and Criminal Background Check** form.
- Once they have received these completed forms, there may be further dialogue about any questions or concerns they have about what you submitted in order to make sure you have the support you need when serving with them.
- If you are cleared to join them, you will then start [fundraising](fundraising.md)! This is also a good time to get stuck into language study, if you haven't already.
- Once you have reached at least the Minimum Support Level of financial support, you can join the team! If you are in need of a visa to live in Japan, we will start the [visa process](visaApply.md)!

You will be guided through this process and you are free to ask any questions anytime!
