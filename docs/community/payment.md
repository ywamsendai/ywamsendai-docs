The preferred method of making fee payments or donations is a bank transfer from your JP Bank account to YWAM Sendai's JP Bank account. This can be easily done either online via JP Direct (ゆうちょダイレクト) or via the ATM.

The YWAM Sendai JP Bank account number is: **10140-65305041**

**Online** (Japanese only):

You can find directions on how to make a transfer [here.](https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/direct/pc/guide/dr_pc_gd_densin.html)
