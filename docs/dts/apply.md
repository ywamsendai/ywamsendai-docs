If you feel you may be called to reach and love the Japanese in Japan, and you desire to grow in your love for God, we would love for you to enroll on our DTS!

As a student at YWAM Sendai, you will become a part of a pioneering missional community as you learn and grow.

## The Application Process

* At any time in this process, feel free to connect with us via [Discord](../community/communication.md), introduce yourself, and ask us any questions. You can also send us an email at [students@ywamsendai.org](mailto:students@ywamsendai.org)

* First, fill out the **[DTS student application form](https://www.ywamsendai.org/en/dtsapp/)**! Once we receive this, we will send a **Character Reference** form to a church leader/pastor that knows you.

* Once we have received the reference, we will pray and discuss as a team about whether we feel this is where God wants you to be. We will then let you know if we are happy continuing with the process, or not.

* If we feel peace about moving forward, we will send you a **Student Registration** form. Along with this form, please send a **registration fee of ¥5,000**.

* Once we have received this completed form and registration fee, we will register you for the DTS!

* We will send you more information at this point, as well as how to send the DTS Lecture Phase fee.

* As you move forward with [fundraising](../community/fundraising.md), you may also find it helpful to start learning some [Japanese](../lifeinjapan/language.md)! 

You will be guided through this process and you are free to ask any questions anytime!
