## Applications

### How do I apply?

You can apply by filling out the [DTS student application form](https://www.ywamsendai.org/en/dtsapp/).

For more details about the application process, [click here](/apply.md).

### Are there any fees involved with applying or registering?

It is free to apply for a DTS, but there is a registration fee of ¥5,000 once you have been accepted.

Registration fees are non-refundable. In the case of a change of plans, the fee may be transferred to a later course – for up to 2 years.

### When is the application deadline?

Applications are generally open up to three weeks before the DTS's Start Date – but there are times when we reach capacity – so the earlier the better!

Please note that the application process may take some time, i.e. to receive your reference back.

### How will I know if I’ve been accepted?

We’ll let you know via email, and this will contain any further additional information you’ll need. 

### Why haven’t I heard back about my application?

It can take up to 2 weeks for your application to be processed once it’s been submitted. If it’s already been this long and you haven’t heard back, we’re sorry! Please email us at people@ywamsendai.org

### Is there an age requirement to attend?

You need to be at least 18 years old by the end of the DTS. In this case, you can apply when you are 17.

### Are there any language requirements to attend?

You need to be able to communicate in either English or Japanese comfortably.

### Do I need a visa to attend?

As a short-term training programme, and because of the complex process of applying for a Religious Activities visa, we can only accept applicants that are national of countries that do not need a visa in order to be in Japan for up to 90 days.

Be of a nationality where you do not need a visa to visit Japan for up to 90 days (Go here for details)

Please [click here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) for details of what countries this includes.

If your nation is not on this list, or it *is* on the list but Japan only permits up to 30 days, we are unfortunately unable to accept your application. In this case, we would recommend you to attend a YWAM DTS elsewhere, then pray about applying as staff if led by God.
