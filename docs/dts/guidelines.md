title: DTS Community Guidelines

In order to make the most of this short but intense DTS season, we have some guidelines to help us to honour and love each other as a community.

## The One Another Passages

Instead of creating many rules for the school, we choose to look to the Bible for how we should live and love.

- Be devoted to one another in brotherly love (Rom 12:10)
- Give preference to one another in honor (Rom 12:10)
- Accept one another (Rom 15:7)
- Serve one another (Gal 5:13)
- Submit to one another (Eph 5:21)
- Teach and admonish one another (Col 3:16)
- Encourage one another (1 Thes 5:11)
- Build up one another (1 Thes 5:11)
- Stimulate one another to love and good deeds (Heb 10:24)
- Confess sins to one another (James 5:16)
- Pray for one another (James 5:16)
- Be hospitable to one another without complaint (1 Peter 4:9)
- Speak truth in love to one another (Eph 4:15-16)

## Community Living Space Rules

Though we keep each other to the above standards, we do have some rules to ensure everyone feels respected.

1. Keep communal areas clean & tidy
2. In communal areas, try to be intentional with not being on devices a lot
3. Aim to be quiet and have lights off by 10pm to encourage good rest & sleep
4. Don’t enter the sleeping areas of opposite gender
5. Possession or consumption of alcohol is prohibited on school property (existing rule of the building we are using)
