title: Passing or Failing the DTS
---

As the YWAM DTS is a programme registered with the University of the Nations, students can pass or fail (or even be expelled from) the school.

## Passing

In order to pass both the Lecture and Outreach phases of the DTS, students must ensure the following:

- Good attendance and whole-hearted participation of all school schedule (e.g. lectures, one-on-ones, small groups, outreaches, worship, intercession etc.)
- Completion of all given assignments (e.g. weekly journals, book reports etc.)
- Adherence to the [school guidelines](guidelines.md)

## Failing or Expulsion

Failing a DTS would be due to not ensuring the above, or due to repeated bad behaviour or actions. We follow the following process, while would end in the student being expelled from the school.

### Step 1 - The Informal Stage: Normal ongoing interaction between staff and student

From the beginning, the DTS community and staff should function according to the [school guidelines](guidelines.md). In this stage, staff are to give consistent encouragement to students in natural ways.

When a student's attitudes or actions have a negative affect on those around them, it is the responsibility of those they affect to confront them. If they resist changing, the staff are to help the student take responsibility for their behaviour. The student simply needs to seek understanding from God and others regarding the attitude or action, ask forgiveness from those affected, and seek to be more Christ-like in this area.

We are not looking for perfection but for attitudes of humility, teachableness and true desire to change. We are most concerned when the student is blind and does not accept any responsibility for their attitudes or behaviours. In this case, it is critical that staff continue to reach out to the student in love and wisdom, without judgement, in an effort to see a break through. When no break through seems apparent Step 2 needs to be taken.

### Step 2 - The Formal Stage: Warning of failure or expulsion

When behaviour is serious enough to warrant possible expulsion or failure from the DTS and/or the student is not responding to the informal efforts in Step 1 then Step 2, the formal stage, is to be taken.

Formal Meeting - This is a planned session between a DTS staff member and the student. The goal of this meeting is two fold:

1. For the student to understand if the behaviour doesn't change they will fail from the program or be expelled. 
2. For the student to understand what changes are necessary for them to pass and not be expelled.

It is important that the student verbalizes that they understand these two things. The staff and the student then work on the solution together, with the staff person coaching and helping them to see the practical steps they can take to rectify the problem. It is vital that the student owns the decision and takes responsibility to implement the steps discussed. It is essential that staff facilitate the student partnering with the Holy Spirit to make the necessary changes. It is necessary to maintain a connection with the student to insure needed changes are made.

### Step 3 - Final Warning

When the agreed upon change does not occur, the student is given one final warning where the staff member and school leader discuss with the student the problem behaviour. The student is given a set period of time within which they are to make their decision to change their behaviour or face the consequences. At this point it might be advisable to share a general account of the issue and process with the rest of the school in line with Matthew 18.

If after this time period the student's decision is not to change, the response is automatic expulsion or failure. If the decision is yes they will change and staff decide the student can continue on in the DTS; but as time goes the student does not change, then the student can be expelled or failed without any further warning.

### Step 4 - Expulsion / Failure

This step results when:

- All other avenues have been exhausted 
- As a result of the decision the student made in the Final Warning stage or for a major and serious breach of the [school guidelines](guidelines.md). 
- After prayer 
- By DTS Leader in consultation with appropriate base leadership

A formal meeting should be held where the student being asked to leave has verbalized the reasons for his expulsion. The student should be clear on what the problem is and where it is he has failed to make right choices or adjust behaviour. The meeting is to be brief and a summary of the process that has brought you to this decision should be given.
