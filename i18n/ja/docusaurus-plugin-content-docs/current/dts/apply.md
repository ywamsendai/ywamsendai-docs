神様への愛を育み、神を人々に知ってもらいたいと願うなら、私たちのDTSに入学してください!

仙台ワイワムの生徒として、学び、訓練することで、国際的な宣教コミュニティの一員となります。

## 申し込み方法

* At any time in this process, feel free to connect with us via [Discord](../community/communication.md), introduce yourself, and ask us any questions. You can also send us an email at [people@ywamsendai.org](mailto:people@ywamsendai.org)

* First, fill out the **[DTS student application form](https://www.ywamsendai.org/en/dtsapp/)**! Once we receive this, we will send a **Character Reference** form to a church leader/pastor that knows you.

* Once we have received the reference, we will pray and discuss as a team about whether we feel this is where God wants you to be. We will then let you know if we are happy continuing with the process, or not.

* If we feel peace about moving forward, we will send you a **Student Registration** form. Along with this form, please send a **registration fee of ¥5,000**.

* Once we have received this completed form and registration fee, we will register you for the DTS!

* We will send you more information at this point, as well as how to send the DTS training phase fee.

* As you move forward with [fundraising](../community/fundraising.md), you may also find it helpful to start learning some [Japanese](../lifeinjapan/language.md)!
