title: DTS Community Guidelines
---

In order to make the most of this short but intense DTS season, we have some guidelines to help us to honour and love each other as a community.

## The One Another Passages

Instead of creating many rules for the school, we choose to look to the Bible for how we should live and love.

- Be devoted to one another in brotherly love (Rom 12:10)
- Give preference to one another in honour (Rom 12:10)
- Accept one another (Rom 15:7)
- Serve one another (Gal 5:13)
- Submit to one another (Eph 5:21)
- Teach and admonish one another (Col 3:16)
- Encourage one another (1 Thes 5:11)
- Build up one another (1 Thes 5:11)
- Stimulate one another to love and good deeds (Heb 10:24)
- Confess sins to one another (James 5:16)
- Pray for one another (James 5:16)
- Be hospitable to one another without complaint (1 Peter 4:9)
- Speak truth in love to one another (Eph 4:15-16)

## Community Living Space Guidelines

Though we keep each other to the above standards, we do have some guidelines to help facilitate a healthy community and space.

1. Keep all areas (both communal & bedroom) clean and tidy
2. In communal areas, try to avoid excessive use of electronic devices
3. Aim to be quiet and have lights off by 10pm to encourage good rest and sleep
4. Don’t enter the sleeping areas of opposite gender
5. Exclusive relationships (especially romantic) are strongly discouraged during DTS
6. Refrain from electronic device usage (besides note taking and Bible) during all scheduled events & meetings (lectures & breaks, mealtimes, worship, intercession, small groups, outreach etc.)
7. As we are using property of another organisation, respect the facilities and adhere to its rules (will be made clear during orientation)
