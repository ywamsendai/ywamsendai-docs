title: Overseeing New YWAM Teams
---

We want to see new YWAM ministries pioneered all over Japan! But when new works are pioneered, we want to ensure that these new teams feel supported and equipped in the work God has for them. We also want to encourage greater accountability between YWAM ministries and locations throughout Japan.

We feel it is important that new teams in Japan have an established YWAM OpLoc in Japan adopt them in an overseeing role. A new team could be one of the following:

- a team sent out from your OpLoc
- a team coming from outside Japan who is desiring your OpLoc oversee them
- a team already in Japan (but not within the legal entity) who is desiring your OpLoc oversee them

This page outlines how a YWAM Japan OpLoc can oversee new teams.


## Relationship

We are called to be in relationship with one another. Here are some things you can do to help support and oversee a team:

- Have your staff pray for them at staff meetings/intercession times
- Have a leader from your ministry visit them in person semi-regularly for a pastoral visit (e.g. quarterly)
- Have a leader from your ministry intentionally keep in touch with their leaders online regularly to check on how they are doing
- Encourage the team to attend YWAM Japan and global YWAM gatherings
- Encourage the team to worship, pray, intercede, and eat together regularly (at least weekly)
- Encourage the team to be active on the [YWAM Japan chat rooms on Element](../community/communication.md), including posting prayer requests
- Connect the leaders with the YWAM Japan ACT

## Practical & Legal

If both your location and the new team are members of YWAM Japan's exisitng Religious Corporation, here are some expectations we have on ministries who oversee teams who join the legal entity:

- Train the team to correctly keep financial records, and to send these records and the staff and ministry (5%) fees to the Religious Corporation's National Office
- Train the team on how to apply for and renew Religious Activities Visas
- Ensure the team is informed about the Religious Corporation's General Meetings that they must attend
- Keep the team accountable moving forward regarding legal responsibilities, taking overall responsibility for any legal issues arising from the new team
