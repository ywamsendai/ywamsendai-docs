title: New Religious Activities Visa
---

**Note:** This page is intended for those with a visa coordinator role at YWAM Japan locations and ministries that are under the legal Religious Corporation (世界青年宣教会).

As YWAM Japan is a registered Religious Corporation, we can assist foreign YWAMers who do not already have residency in Japan in receiving a Religious Activities Visa.

If you have a new staff member joining you who do not yet have residency permission to live in Japan, part of their [process to join as YWAM Japan staff](../community/join.md) is to receive a visa from Japanese Immigration. This page details this process. **Please follow this process carefully.**

If you have any questions about anything on this page, please communicate with the National Office.

## The Process

- The incoming staff member will inform you that they have reached at least the [Minimum Support Level](../community/fundraising.md) of financial support you have agreed upon and would like to begin this process.
- Request **required documentation** from the applicant via **both** email and physical mail (detailed below).
- Fill out the [Certificate of Eligibility (CoE) Application form](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004037.pdf) (As found on the [Immigration website](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/16-1.html)). You may need further information from the applicant to help you.
- Inform the National Office of this visa application and request an **Invitation/Warranty** letter, which they will mail to you.
- Take the application form and all required documentation to your local Immigration office. You may need some form of YWAM ID (i.e. business card) with you in case they ask.
- Once you receive the CoE, mail it to the applicant.
- Apply for a **Certificate for Completion of Registration to the ERFS system** and fill out a **Declaration form**. Email both of these documents to the applicant.
- They will then **go to their local Japanese Embassy or Consulate** and submit a **Visa Application** form, **CoE**, **Certificate for Completion of Registration to the ERFS system**, **Declaration form**, and **passport** in order to apply for their visa.
- Once they have their visa, they should be in communication with you as they book their flight to Japan. They must enter Japan within 3 months of receiving their visa.

## Required Documentation for CoE

**From the applicant:**

- A 4cm x 3cm portrait **photograph** (should be clear, with a plain background, and recently taken. Applicant in photo should be facing forward, without sunglasses, hats, etc.)
- Copy of applicant's **passport photo page** (the copy must be clear and all information legible)
- Two original, signed letters on church stationary, *not copies*, from their sending church: **Letter of Dispatch** and **Letter of Release**. (It may be helpful for you to provide templates for them to use, which will make translation easier.)

**From you:**

- **Application form**
- **Envelope** with your address and **404 yen postage stamp** (simplified registered mail)
- **Invitation/Warranty** letter - from National Office
- **Japanese translations** of the Letter of Dispatch and Letter of Release
- A letter (in Japanese) explaining **why we do not have employment insurance**, as requested in question number 3 on page 3 of the application form. We do not provide a salary, and living expenses are covered by sending church. (This may not be necessary, but was requested by at least one immigration office.)
