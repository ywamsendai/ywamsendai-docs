title: Religious Activities Visa Renewal
---

**Note:** This page is intended for those with a visa coordinator role at YWAM Japan locations and ministries that are under the legal Religious Corporation (世界青年宣教会).

Staff can start the process of renewing their Religious Worker visa from **3 months** prior to it expiring. We recommend they start the process of gathering the required documents prior to this.

The staff member will do the majority of the work themselves, but they will need our assistance. This page details what is necessary on our side.

## The Process

- The applicant will message you the following: residence card number, length of desired visa extension (**1, 3, or 5 years**), and the **name and address of their sending church**.
- The above information will help you to then fill in **page 3** of the **[Visa Application Form](http://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930004102.pdf)**. Once complete, give it to the applicant.
- Inform the National Office of this visa renewal and request an **Invitation/Warranty** letter, which they will mail to you. Give this to the applicant.
- The applicant will need a Letter of Dispatch and Letter of Release from their sending church. (It may be helpful for you to provide templates for them to use, which will make translation easier.)
- When the applicant receives the two church letters, **translate them into Japanese** and give to the applicant.
- The applicant will then go to the local immigration office and apply for their renewed visa.


## Required Documentation

This is the documentation you will need to provide to the applicant:

- **Page 3 of the Application Form**
- **Invitation/Warranty** letter - from National Office
- **Japanese translations** of the Letter of Dispatch and Letter of Release
- A letter (in Japanese) explaining **why we do not have employment insurance**, as requested in question number 3 on page 3 of the application form. We do not provide a salary, and living expenses are covered by sending church. (This may not be necessary, but was requested by at least one immigration office.)
